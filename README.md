## README

This repository is under development and will contain my own, personal calculations, regarding the current epidemic here in Italy, in hopes that this information could be useful somehow.

<em>I am not an epidemiologist, just a simple mathematician.</em>

## Technical instructions

In case you wished to verify the output produced by the project locally, on your machine, a folder named "COVID-19" with the official data from the Italian Civil Protection Department should be present.  That is, manually downloaded or cloned via git.

<em>It was included in .gitignore, as appropriate</em>.
